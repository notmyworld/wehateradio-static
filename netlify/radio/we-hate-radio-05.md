This was a hard one to put together and we hate the term 'best of' so you have to see it more like a playlist of the highlights of Dutch punk. I did not get to put everything in there because of the time limit. And without a doubt, some people will hear the show and be wondering why I didn't put 'some band name' in there. But we will do another 'Best of contemporary Dutch punk' in the future and will be covering the rest. Big shout out to all the great Dutch punk band in the list and big thanks to Darcy Records for providing me with some of the records.
